## Introduction

* Title: NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic)
* Url: [https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv)
* Dataset description:  List of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year.

This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. This data can be used by the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity. Please refer to the attached data footnotes for additional information about this dataset.

## Import libraries

To access the datasets and functions that we will use in this project, load the libraries `tidyverse` and `lubridate` by running the following codes:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Load the data

We will load the data in R with the **readr** package, which is part of the core `tidyverse`.

Most of **readr**'s functions are concerned with turning flat files into data frames:

`read_csv()` reads comma-delimited files, `read_csv2()` reads semicolon-separated files, `read_tsv()` reads tab-delimited files, and `read_delim()` reads in files with any delimiter.

Here, we will use `read_csv()`.

```{r import_data}
url_in <- 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv'
NYPD <- read_csv(url_in)
```

## Check the data structure

```{r check_stucture}
glimpse(NYPD)  
```

## Possible bias

1. Different boroughs may have different security levels, which means they have different numbers of shooting incidents. Brooklyn probably has a higher crime rate than other boroughs.
2. Different age groups can have different shootings incident rate. 20s may be more inclined to shoot.

## Analytics plan

1. We will check the number of incident by borough and age group to verify the bias above.
2. We will also leverage modeling method to find the relation between number of death and number of incidents.

## Data transform

We need to change OCCUR_DATE to date format.

```{r change_date}

NYPD$OCCUR_DATE <- as.Date(NYPD$OCCUR_DATE,format='%m/%d/%Y')

```

#### Count the number of incident by each borough in NY in 2021 to see which area has more cases.

```{r summarize_borough}
NYPD_by_boro_2021 <- NYPD %>% 
  mutate(OCCUR_DATE = as.Date(OCCUR_DATE,format='%m/%d/%Y')) %>% 
  filter( between(OCCUR_DATE, as.Date("2021-01-01"), as.Date("2021-12-31"))) %>% 
  group_by(BORO) %>%
  summarize(cases =n()) %>%
  select(BORO,cases) %>%
  ungroup()

NYPD_by_boro_2021
```

#### Get the borough with the highest number of shooting incident.

```{r top_boro}
NYPD_by_boro_2021 %>% 
  slice_max(cases, n=1)
```

#### Get the death rate of shooting incident for each borough in 2021.

```{r summarize_death_boro}
NYPD_death_rate_by_boro <- NYPD %>%
    mutate(OCCUR_DATE = as.Date(OCCUR_DATE,format='%m/%d/%Y')) %>% 
    filter( between(OCCUR_DATE, as.Date("2021-01-01"), as.Date("2021-12-31"))) %>% 
    group_by(BORO) %>%
    summarize(cases =n(),deaths = sum(STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG)) %>%
    mutate(deaths_rate = round(deaths / cases,3)) %>%
    ungroup()
NYPD_death_rate_by_boro
```

#### Get the borough with the highest death rate in shooting incident.

```{r top_death_rate_boro}
NYPD_death_rate_by_boro %>% 
  slice_max(deaths_rate, n=1)
```

#### Count the number of incident by perpetratorâ€™s age group in 2021.

```{r summarize_age}
NYPD_by_age <- NYPD %>%
    mutate(OCCUR_DATE = as.Date(OCCUR_DATE,format='%m/%d/%Y')) %>% 
    filter( between(OCCUR_DATE, as.Date("2021-01-01"), as.Date("2021-12-31"))) %>% 
    filter(! is.na(PERP_AGE_GROUP)) %>%
    group_by(PERP_AGE_GROUP) %>%
    summarize(cases =n()) %>%
    select(PERP_AGE_GROUP,cases) %>%
    ungroup()
NYPD_by_age
```

#### Get the age group with the highest number of incident.

```{r top_age}
NYPD_by_age %>% 
  slice_max(cases, n=1)
```

## Visualize number of cases by borough 

```{r chart_boro}
options(repr.plot.width=30, repr.plot.height=8)
ggplot(NYPD_by_boro_2021, aes(reorder(BORO, cases, sum), cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#4472C4") +
  geom_text(aes(label=cases), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), hjust=0) + 
  coord_flip() +   
  labs(title = "Number of Shooting Incidents by Borough in 2021", y= NULL)+
  theme(text=element_text(size=10)) 
```

## Visualize death rate per incident by borough

```{r chart_date_rate_boro}
options(repr.plot.width=30, repr.plot.height=8)
ggplot(NYPD_death_rate_by_boro, aes(reorder(BORO, deaths_rate, sum), deaths_rate)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#ED7D31") +
  geom_text(aes(label=deaths_rate), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), hjust=-0.1) + 
  coord_flip() +   
  labs(title = "Death Rate per Shooting Incident by Borough in 2021", y= NULL) + 
  theme(text=element_text(size=10)) #change font size of legend title
```

## Visualize number of cases by age group

```{r chart_age}
options(repr.plot.width=30, repr.plot.height=8)
ggplot(NYPD_by_age, aes(reorder(PERP_AGE_GROUP, cases, sum), cases)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#00BFC4") + coord_flip() +
    geom_text(aes(label=cases), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), hjust=-0.1) + 
    labs(title = "Number of Shooting Incidents by Age", y= NULL) +
    theme(text=element_text(size=10))
```

## Build a model (i)
Build a model to see the relationship between number of deaths and number of shooting incidents.

```{r prep_for_model}

NYPD_by_month <- NYPD %>%
    mutate(OCCUR_DATE = as.Date(OCCUR_DATE,format='%m/%d/%Y')) %>%
    mutate(OCCUR_MONTH = strftime(OCCUR_DATE,format='%Y/%m')) %>%
    mutate(Month = strftime(OCCUR_DATE,format='%m')) %>%
    group_by(OCCUR_MONTH,Month) %>%
    summarize(deaths = sum(STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG), cases= n())
```

```{r model}
mod <- lm(deaths  ~ cases  , data = NYPD_by_month)
summary(mod)
```

## Predict number of deaths with the model

```{r pred_death}
pred <- tibble(pred = predict(mod))
NYPD_by_month_w_pred <- cbind(NYPD_by_month,pred)
```

## Plot predicted deaths and actual deaths

```{r plot_death}
options(repr.plot.width=30, repr.plot.height=8)
NYPD_by_month_w_pred %>% ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x=cases, y=deaths, size = 1.5), color = "red") +
   geom_point(aes(x = cases, y = pred,size = 1.5), color = "blue") +
   geom_line(aes(x = cases, y = pred ),linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
   labs(title = "Model deaths with cases", y= NULL) +
   theme(text=element_text(size=10)) #change font size of legend title
```

## Build a model (ii)
Build a model to see the relationship between number of shooting incidents and calendar month.

```{r model2}
mod_m <- lm(cases ~ Month , data = NYPD_by_month)
summary(mod_m)
```

## Predict number of cases with the model

```{r pred_cases}
pred_m <- tibble(pred_m = predict(mod_m))

NYPD_by_month_w_pred <- cbind(NYPD_by_month_w_pred,pred_m)
```

## Plot predicted deaths and actual deaths

```{r plot_case_model}
options(repr.plot.width=30, repr.plot.height=8)
NYPD_by_month_w_pred %>% ggplot() +
   geom_point(aes(x=Month, y=cases, size = 0.5), color = "red") +
   geom_line(aes(x = Month, y = pred_m ),linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") + 
   geom_point(aes(x = Month, y = pred_m,size = 1.5), color = "blue") +
   labs(title = "Model cases with month", y= NULL) +
   theme(text=element_text(size=10)) #change font size of legend title
```

## Conclusion

Based on our analysis of the NYPD Shooting Incident Data, for the year 2021, we have the following:

* BRONX had more shootings than other boroughs.
* The Staten Island had the highest fatality rate from shootings.
* The shooting incidents were mainly committed by people with age group of 25-44.
* There were 18% possibility of dying in a shooting incident.
* The number of shooting incidents in July and August were more than other months.
